If there is already a lock for a sequence with the same name (usually meaning that the previous invocation has not completed), then this function blocks the sequence from beginning.

This is beneficial because certain logical sequences (such as complex animations) must not be started again before being ended completely.

You should have a call to `cq.end()` when the function is done.  The `sequenceName` value is passed as the first parameter to the callback function as a convenience.
